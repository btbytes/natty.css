# natty.css

all the css gains, all natty! 

[**demo page**](https://btbytes.github.io/natty.css/)

the idea behind `natty.css` is that you should be able to use just the right 
amount of CSS to style your webpage. What `natty.css` provides is:

1. default styling for most commonly used elements
2. use system fonts that are available on most popular operating systems
3. use sans-serif fonts
4. use `em` for defining width instead of `px`

`natty.css` was inspired by [nat.org](https://nat.org),which has inspired many ai companies e.g: [Meta Superintelligence](https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/), and an earlier version of [ssi](https://ssi.inc) etc.


## how to use it

copy [natty.css](natty.css), **Read through the 12 lines** and delete everything
you don't need. you are not planning write any code? delete the `code` line.
