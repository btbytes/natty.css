# Natty.CSS

All the CSS gains, all Natty! 

[**Demo Page**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/btbytes/natty.css/blob/main/index.html)

The idea behind `natty.css` is that you should be able to use just the right 
amount of CSS to style your webpage. What `natty.css` provides is:

1. default styling for most commonly used elements
2. use system fonts that are available on most popular operating systems
3. use sans-serif fonts
4. use `em` for defining width instead of `px`

`natty.css` was inspired by [nat.org](https://nat.org),which has inspired many AI companies e.g: [Meta Superintelligence](https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/), and an earlier version of [ssi](https://ssi.inc) etc.


## How to use it

Copy [natty.css](natty.css), **Read through the 11 lines** and delete everything
you don't need. You are not planning write any code? delete the `code` line.
