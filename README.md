The idea behind `natty.css` is that you should be able to use just the right 
amount of CSS to style your webpage. `natty.css` was inspired by [nat.org](https://nat.org),
which has inspired many AI companies e.g: [Meta Superintelligence](https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/), and an earlier version of [ssi](https://ssi.inc) etc.


## How to use it

Copy [natty.css](natty.css), **Read through the 11 lines** and delete everything
you don't need. You are not planning write any code? delete the `code` line.
