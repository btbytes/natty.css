<h2>all the css gains, all natty!</h2>

<p>the idea behind <code>natty.css</code> is that you should be able to
use just the right amount of CSS to style your webpage. What
<code>natty.css</code> provides is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>default styling for most commonly used elements</li>
<li>use system fonts that are available on most popular operating
systems</li>
<li>use sans-serif fonts</li>
<li>use <code>em</code> for defining width instead of
<code>px</code></li>
<li>this also prints well; “wywsiwyg” since the width is
<code>43em.</code></li>
<li>supports dark-mode</li>
<li>change theme colors if you like (line 1, 2)</li>
</ol>
<p><code>natty.css</code> was inspired by <a
href="https://nat.org">nat.org</a>,which has inspired many ai companies
e.g: <a href="https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/">Meta
Superintelligence</a>, and an earlier version of <a
